            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Majesty hath had so long and so deare experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the treacheries, cruelties, and oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of those Rebels at Westminster, who call themselves a Parliament, that wee need not lay before your Majesty, the evill consequence of their pernicious practises, or strive with farre fetcht Oratory, to dissect their divellish devices; we therefore shall proceed in all humblenesse, prostrating our selves at your Majesties feet, to implore your gracious acceptance and consideration, of these following Propositions, which we know will prove most pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to your Majesty, your posterity and friends.</p>
            <p>First, wee humbly desire your Majesty to call to minde that the Rebels (by the permission of God for the sins of this Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) having overcome &amp; subdued your forces, &amp; having bought your person of the Scots, notwithstanding that by their Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant they had solemnly protested, that they took not up Armes against your Majesty, or in contempt of your just power, but to redeeme you out of their hands who were Yours and the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes enemies; and that done to elevate your throne much higher then all your ancestors, and to make you the most great and glorious Prince in the world; yet when they had atchieved their intentions, had quite beaten your friends, and had your person at their owne disposing, they quite forgot what they had so solemnly protested, and in stead thereof became studious which way to put your Majesty from all your Priviledges and possessions, to alter the fundamentall Lawes of the Land, and to set up a perfect Anarchy.</p>
            <p>For the effecting of which, they underhand dealt with some chiefe Officers in the Army, to betray your person into the Isle of Wight, yet so that the people might imagine it as your own wish; which done, and your Majestie clapt up close prisoner, the same condition that you are now (in a maner) in, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:43700:3"/>to make themselves a State, and for that purpose they openly declared in print, that they would no longer repose trust in your Majesty, as being the murtherer of your father, and a contriver of the ruine of your people: that therefore they would (for the future) have nothing to doe with you, neyther make any addresses to you, or receive any letter from you, but of themselves would settle the Kingdome.</p>
            <p>But then being arrived at the height of their mischiefe, and imagining the people were so perfectly infatuated, that they would have sat still like creatures voyd of understanding, and have suffered themselves and posterity to bee for ever enslaved, they began to declare themselves altogether in their own name, your Majesty never mentioned, to appropriate to themselves all your Majesties power, and in all things to make themselves as absolute as the States of Holland; and they had certainely performed their intents, to the utter ruine of your Majesty your posterity, and subjects, had it not pleased God mercifully to looke upon us, and to illuminate the eyes of the people, who on a sudden became sensible of their owne wretched estate, and withall resolute to hazard their lives for the regayning of their liberties, your Majesties subjects of Kent, beginning the first e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xample, and now at present the whole Nation, being all upon rising: neither did it please God, that only upon the Land these bloudy Rebels should find unwonted opposition but also upon the Sea, in regard your Majesties best Ships (formerly in their possession) are revolted from them: your Majesties sonne his Highnesse the Duke of Yorke, and also your Majesties subjects of Scotland, being now entred into England, for the service of your Majesty with a great Army both of horse and foot, who are now already joyned with other your subjects in the North: Castles. Forts, Cities, and Townes, being daily ceased upon for your Majesty: now that they perceive the people are so in love with Monarchicall government, and the sweet blessing of of Peace, under a peacefull and Righteous King, having found by experience that without your Majesty be possessed of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they are no longer a free people, but open to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious injunctions of Rebells and Traytors; therefore now
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:43700:3"/>they can no longer share the crowne, they are contented that your Majesty have it intire; whereas the world knowes that if they could any longer have supported their usurped power, your Majesty should have been kept prisoner till the day of your death if perhaps their feares would have permitted them to have spared your life, and not to have made you away by poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, or otherwise, as they lately attempted, by their Hellish instrument <hi>Rolfe</hi>) your children kept out of the Land by armed men, and themselves have commanded the lives and estates of the people at their pleasures.</p>
            <p>We therefore humbly beseech your Majesty to behold this their forced submission, with a sterne and rigid eye, and to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steeme of them no otherwise, but as men beaten to a TREA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TIE, yours and the Kingdomes implacable Enemies, and therefore utterly uncapable of any trust for the future.</p>
            <p>Secondly, we beseech your Majesty so to respect your owne Person, and the glory of your fame, as not to suffer your selfe to be brought up to London as a Pageant, a May-game for the Sectaries to behold and laugh at, and then to be returned back to your Cell, and to be cloystered up more strictly then before; for let your Majesty know that the Cittizens of London have already agreed, that in case your Majesty shall not make up an agreement with the Rebells, they will not secure your per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from them, but will deliver you up to be againe disposed of according to their wisdomes (their very words) the nature of their disposall we know your Majesty cannot but imagine.</p>
            <p>To prevent the manner of which Tyrannicall mock Treaty, we humbly beseech your Majesty (since they must be constrai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to come to composition will they nill they) before you as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure them that you deigne to treat, to have the <hi>Militia,</hi> and <hi>Navy</hi> (we meane those that have not yet declared for you) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stored unto your command, new Officers Chosen, whom you by the advice of your friends shall nominate, and they anew to take the Oath of Alegeance and supremacy, that so your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty may Treate with safety, and like your selfe, and not be as you have beene hitherto, a mock and derision to your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, who fat themselves with yours, and your Subjects ruines.</p>
            <pb n="6" facs="tcp:43700:4"/>
            <p> Thirdly, that ere your Majesty condiscend to treat, you will please, that your Wife our Soveraigne Lady, and most graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Queene <hi>Mary,</hi> your sonne his highnesse the Prince of <hi>Wales,</hi> and the rest of your Loyall friends beyond the Seas, who have this many yeares beene kept from the injoyment of their owne by the perfidiousnesse of the Rebells at <hi>Westminster,</hi> and to the immortal infamy of this Nation have been suffered to live upon the almes of strangers, be called home againe, your Wife to your bosome, your sonne to your tuition, and your friends to your counsell, that so you may returne in full luster, and be a peace-maker in as much glory as your Ancestors.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, that all those who have survived the fury of the Rebels, aswell the Lords spirituall (who contrary to the Funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall Lawes of the Land, were outed the house, and their voyce in Parliament taken away) as the Lords temporall, and those loyall ones of the Communalty, who either deserted the Rebels, as foreseeing their intents, or were violently expul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed for denying to joine with them in their treasonable and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structive undertakings, may be restored to their places in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that so your Majesty may not be exposed to the inevitable inconveniences, that will else assuredly happen, or be destitute of a party equivolent to the Rebells, that so in case (which if any attempt with safety can performe shall be surely effected) that the Treaty should not be prevalent, your Majesty may be in a condition to dissolve this old Rebellious (and indeed onely by name, and not in substance) Parliament, and may according to your wonted power, command the convening of another, who may declare all their mischievous Orders null and voyd, and restore this Kingdome to its ancient and excellent forme of Government.</p>
            <p>These our desires being so consonant to your Majesties, and this Kingdomes happinesse, as that without the punctuall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them, neither your Majesty, or this Kingdome can expect any future tranquility, but still to be involved in dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stique debates, and never dying miseries, so long as there shalbe two in a family, or till England become another <hi>Golgotha▪</hi> wee beseech your Majesty to take into your serious consideration,
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:43700:4"/>and to adhere to them as the only meanes for your owne, your posterity and peoples safety.</p>

            <p>VVHereas wee have found by many yeares experience, that those at Westminster (who fit and vote without his Majesties assent, and whom he hath proclaymed to bee Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels and Traytors to his Crowne and Dignity, as appeares by many Declarations yet extant) have convened and assembled themselves together, under pretence to reforme abuses, and yet permit all maner of enormities, and tolerate all maner of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, massacres, plunders, and outrages, to the apparant ruine and inevitable destruction of the Nation (if not timely prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) We the Lords, Knights, and Gentlemen now in Armes for the redemption of his Majesties person out of captivity, and for the recovery of our Lawes and Liberties, doe order and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dayne, That from henceforth the Rebels at Westminster, who audaciously call themselves a Parliament, shall no more bee di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguished by that name, but tearmed on all occasions by the fit and due epithites of Traytors, Rebels, and destroyers of their Nation and Country: and we doe heereby decree and ordaine, and be it ordained and decreed, by the King our Soveraign Lord, the Lords, Knights, Gentry and Commons now in Armes, for the purchasing of their lost freedomes, that whosoever shall joine or yeeld assistance to those pernicious and bloud-sucking Rebels at Westminster, either by person or purse, so to obstruct the speedy settlement of the Kingdome, are Traytors and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels by the Lawes of God, and the Lawes of the Land, and shall be so lookt upon, their estates confiscate, and themselves puni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed with death.
